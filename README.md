# Homeless Kitten association website:

This site will contribute to the adoption of cats by foster families who will be able to register on the site as adopters. Families will be able to post publications in the dedicated section, in order to give news of the cats they have adopted.

Donations can be made to the association, via PayPal, Teaming or by bank transfer.

This site will also reference events taking place in the municipality of Bourges (18000), France and the surrounding area, such as food collections or the trapping of stray cats.
